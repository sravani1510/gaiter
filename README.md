# Gaiter

The main aim of this project is when a user uploads image of the leg, by using the cursor required length are calculated from image between any two points and and they are used to in preparation of gaiter for disabled people
Advantage of this project is rather than going offline to nearest places to give measurements of leg, they can just upload their leg images by placing a coin as reference in the uploaded image based on which the measurements are calculated and sent so that personalised gaiter can be prepared without any efforts in an easy way using the technology.
